# Implementation Plan for Production Readiness

This document details the step-by-step actions required to bring the concert setlist voting web app to production readiness. It is based on the previously approved production-readiness plan.

---

## 1. Database Layer Improvements

### A. Schema Audit
- **Review Migration Files:**
  - **001_create_exec_sql.sql:**  
    - Confirm table definitions for core tables (Artists, Shows, Setlists/Votes).
    - Verify constraints, foreign keys, and primary keys.

  - **002_sync_tables.sql & sync-system-tables.sql:**  
    - Ensure sync/task log tables have proper indexes and constraints.
    - Validate that any stored procedures or triggers (e.g., vote functions) include error handling.

### B. Optimization Recommendations
- Add indexes on columns commonly used in WHERE clauses (e.g., foreign keys, `artist_id`).
- Audit and optimize stored procedures for performance.

---

## 2. API & Sync System Enhancements

### A. API Endpoints
- **Admin APIs:**
  - Ensure endpoints like `/api/admin/set-admin.ts` are wrapped in robust error handling (try/catch blocks).
  - Enforce authentication and authorization for admin routes.
  
- **Shows & Artists APIs:**
  - Verify endpoints (e.g., `/api/setlist/[artistId]/route.ts`, `/api/shows/[id]/route.ts`) have proper input validation and error logging.
  - Optimize database queries (e.g., use pagination for large datasets).

### B. Sync System
- **Client Libraries (src/lib/sync/):**
  - Review modules like `artist-service.ts`, `show-service.ts`, `setlist-service.ts`, etc.
  - Implement retry logic and error handling for external API calls.
  
- **Supabase Functions (supabase/functions/):**
  - Audit deployed sync functions (`sync-artist`, `sync-setlist`, `sync-show`, `sync-song`, `sync-venue`).
  - Ensure logging mechanisms are in place to capture failures.
  - Consider decoupling heavy data operations as background jobs if needed.

## 3. Admin & Main UI Improvements

### A. Admin Section

- **Dashboard & Management Pages:**
  - Update the AdminArtists component to resolve TypeScript errors and improve data typing.
  - Enhance the AdminArtistImport page for smoother artist data import.

### B. Main Pages (Shows & Artists)

- **Shows:**
  - Optimize pages like `Shows.tsx`, `ShowDetail.tsx`, and `CreateShow.tsx` for clarity and performance.
  - Refine and standardize UI components such as `ShowCard.tsx`, `ShowHeader.tsx`, and `ShowSetlist.tsx`.

- **Artists:**
  - Improve `Artists.tsx` and `ArtistDetail.tsx` with accurate type definitions and better error handling.
  - Update components (e.g., `ArtistSetlists.tsx`, `ArtistStats.tsx`) to ensure consistent and responsive design following Shadcn UI and TailwindCSS guidelines.

### C. Routing & Security
- Leverage Next.js file-based routing to ensure proper SSR.
- Secure sensitive routes (admin and sync) with authentication middleware and role-based access control.

---

## 4. Testing & Documentation

### A. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write tests for API endpoints, sync functions, and utility modules.
  
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Create tests for core flows such as artist management, show creation, and data synchronization.

### B. Documentation
- Update the project's README and add dedicated documentation for:
  - Database schema details.
  - API endpoints and their expected inputs/outputs.
  - Sync process workflows.
- Maintain the implementation plan and production-readiness guide for future reference.

## 5. High-Level Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Audit & Review**
   - Audit database migration scripts and table schemas.
   - Review API endpoints and sync modules for error handling and security.

2. **Phase 2: Code Enhancements**
   - Implement database optimizations (indexes, constraints).
   - Update API endpoints with robust error handling and security.
   - Fix TypeScript issues and UI inconsistencies in admin and main pages.

3. **Phase 3: Testing & Documentation**
   - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
   - Update documentation and internal guides.

## Next Steps

1. **Code Reviews & Refactoring:**
   - Start with addressing TypeScript and UI refinements in admin components.
   - Audit API endpoints and apply consistent error handling patterns.

2. **Database Optimizations:**
   - Adjust migration scripts if necessary and add documentation for schema changes.

3. **Sync System Enhancements:**
   - Integrate retry logic and logging in sync functions.

4. **Testing & Documentation:**
   - Develop unit/integration tests.
   - Finalize documentation and update the README with production readiness guidelines.

This plan serves as a roadmap to systematically bring the app to production quality. Once reviewed, we can switch modes to implementation and start applying these changes.
